/**
 * The code in this package shows an example of the enum type: it is useful when you have to group together
 * and use a set of constant values (enumerated types, typically strings). In Currency we create five name values, which
 * represent currencies.
 * You can think about enum as a class, which has some useful methods like ordinal(), to indicate the declaration order of
 * a particular enum constant, and values(), a method that produces an array of values of the enum constant in the
 * order they are declared.
