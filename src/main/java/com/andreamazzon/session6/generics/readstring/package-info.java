/**
 * The code in this package, together with the one in com.andeamazzon.session6.generics.fibonacci,
 * shows an example of the use of generics. The class CharactersOfString here and the class
 * FibonacciSequence in the package above both implement the interface GenericPointer defined in
 * com.andeamazzon.session6.generics.genericinterfaces. The method next() defined in GenericPointer
 * returns a Character in this case and an Integer in FibonacciSequence. So it made sense to avoid to set
 * the return type in the definition of next() in the interface. However, we wanted to be consistent, i.e.,
 * that the return type is the same for every object of a class implementing next(): we did not want a
 * possible implementation of next(), specific of a class, to give one time an Integer and the other a Double.
 * So we used generics in GenericPointer.
 * In the case of this package, the implementation of next() gives a way to read and return the characters
 * of a string, when called iteratively.
